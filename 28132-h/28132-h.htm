<h2>"WHY DID ELFRIDA GO TO SLEEP?"</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 113px;">
<img src="images/illus098.png" width="113" height="125" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HAT was the question, "Why did Elfrida go to
sleep?" She had been sent to the grocer's in
the village; and the grocer's was only half a
mile off from Brook Cottage, where she lived
with her aunt and five cousins. She had been
sent to buy a pound of sugar, half a pound of coffee, and
five small rolls of bread.</div>

<p>Usually she would go to the shop and return in less than
half an hour. Now a whole hour went by, and no Elfrida
was to be seen. What could be the matter? Had she run
a thorn into her foot, and been lamed? Had she stopped to
talk with the children on their way home from school? Had
she been run over by a fast horse?</p>

<p>"Let us go and find her," cried James, the eldest of the
three boys. "Let us all go!" echoed Susan, his youngest
sister. "Shall Sport go with us?" asked Emma. "By all
means!" said James. "Here, Sport, Sport! Where are
you, old fellow?" A big black-and-white Newfoundlander
soon rushed frisking in, wagging his tail, and seeming ready
to eat up every one of the children, just to show them how
fond he was of them all.</p>

<p>Then the children all set out for Mr. Spicer's shop.
There they learned that no Elfrida had been seen in the
shop that afternoon. "Where can she be?" cried James,
a little anxious. "Sport, where is Elfrida?"</p>

<p>Sport stopped his nonsense of playing with a stick, and
began to look serious. Then he made a bee-line for the
nearest turning on the right, on the way home. This was
an old lane, on which some old gardens backed, and which
led, by a little longer way, to Brook Cottage.</p>

<p>By the time the children had arrived at the head of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
lane, Sport was seen galloping back in a state of great
excitement. "Bow-wow!"&mdash;"Oh, you have found her,
have you, old fellow?"&mdash;"Bow-wow!"&mdash;"Well and
good! You are a jolly old Sport!"</p>

<p>On the step of the gate of an old garden sat Elfrida, fast
asleep, with her empty basket in her lap. Emma proposed
to tickle her nose with a straw. "No! I will pull that thick
braid of hair," said Susan. "No! let me whisper in her
ear," said James. But, before anybody did any thing, Sport
settled the question by putting his paws up on her shoulders,
and crying, "Bow-wow!"</p>

<p>Elfrida started, and looked around as if in a dream.
"What does it mean? How long have I been here?"
cried she. "Why did you go to sleep?" asked the two
girls. "Yes, why, why, did you go to sleep?" echoed all
the boys. "Oh, that's my secret," said Elfrida. "Now
who can catch me in my run to Mr. Spicer's?" So off she
started, followed by Sport and all the children.</p>

<p>"Now tell us why did you go to sleep?" said the children,
as they were all on their way home, after she had made her
purchases. "Will you promise not to tell anybody, if I tell
you?" asked Elfrida. "We promise, we promise!" cried
all the children. "Now, then, why did you go to sleep?"&mdash;"Hush!
I went to sleep because&mdash;because&mdash;because I
was sleepy," said Elfrida.</p>

<h2>THE PRAIRIE-DOG</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> friend John lives in Colorado, not far from Denver;
and he writes me, that he and his sister, not long ago,
walked out to see some prairie-dogs.</p>

<p>The prairie-dog is about the size of a full-grown squirrel,
and of a like color. It makes a hole for itself in the ground.
This hole is in the shape of a tunnel, and as large round as
a man's hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus100.png" width="300" height="232" alt="Prairie Dogs" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, this little dog is so gentle, that he lets the owl and
the rattlesnake come and live with him, if they like. All
three are often found dwelling together. For my part, I
should not much like such neighbors.</p>

<p>The prairie-dogs live on the roots of grass. Scattered all
around the entrance to their homes, you may see remnants
of the dry roots which they have got for food. They are
quick in their movements, and quite playful.</p>

<p>Johnny writes me, that, when some of these little dogs
saw him and his sister approaching, they sat down on their
hind-legs, and began barking. Then they dropped into
their holes backwards. As Johnny did not care to wake up
any of the other lodgers, he and his sister went home, well
content with their first sight of a prairie-dog.</p>

</div>



<h2>STRUT</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Strut</span> was the name of a hen that lived on Father Nunn's
farm, nine miles from Norwalk, Ohio.</p>

<p>She was very vain; that is, she had a very good opinion
of herself. She always would strut when walking. Indeed,
it was hard for her to pick up grains of corn as other chickens
did. I think she never saw her feet in her life: certainly
she never looked where she stepped.</p>

<p>Worse than all this, when she saw any person in the yard,
instead of dodging away, as a modest hen should, she would
strut right up to such a person, and look saucily in his face,
as though asking, "Who are you? Where are you going?
What for?"</p>

<p>At last, however, Strut received a severe rebuke for her
evil ways. Cousin William Bird, who is soon to be a doctor,
was visiting at Father Nunn's. Having occasion to climb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the ladder to the barn-loft, he saw Strut on the farther side.
He knew that she would come straight to him; and he also
knew that she would not look where she stepped. So he
held still to see what would happen; for exactly between
them was an opening in the floor for throwing down hay.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Strut started for Cousin William, and, stepping
off the edge of the hole, fell fluttering, cackling, and
frightened, to the floor beneath.</p>

<p>She was humbled by her fall; for she never strutted
again, but walked and ate afterwards like other chickens.</p>

<h2>THE CATERPILLARS</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Eight</span> great cabbages growing in the ground;<br />
Crowds of little caterpillars crawling all around;<br />
Caterpillars squirmed about, and wriggled in the sun;<br />
Said, "These cabbages look sweet: suppose we taste of one!"<br />
<br />
Down flew a hungry bird, coming from the wood,<br />
Saw the caterpillars there, and said, "Won't those taste good!"<br />
Up crept pussy-cat, hunting round for mice,<br />
Saw the bird, and smacked her lips, and said, "Won't he taste nice!"<br />
<br />
Dog saw pussy creeping there, and he began to run,<br />
Said, "Now I will frighten puss, and then there will be fun!"<br />
So doggy barked; and pussy hid; and birdie flew away;<br />
And caterpillars lived to eat a cabbage up that day.<br />

<h2>THIRD LESSON IN ASTRONOMY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> told you about the sun and the stars. Can you
think of any thing else in the sky that you would like to
know a little about? Of course, I do not mean the dark
clouds, but something bright and pretty, that all children
love to look at.</p>

<p>I think you must have guessed that I mean the moon,&mdash;the
beautiful moon. Now, I want you to make another
guess: Is the moon bright because it is made of fire, like the
sun; or because the sun shines on it, as it does on Venus and
Jupiter?</p>

<p>If any of you think it is made of fire, you must try to
warm your little toes and fingers in the moonlight, as you do
in the sunshine, and you will find out for yourselves that it
is not a great fire, like the sun, and that you cannot get
warm in the light of it.</p>

<p>And now you will guess at once, that, if it is not fire itself,
it must shine from the sun's fire; and that is right. The
moon itself is cold and dark. It is the light of the sun that
makes it look bright to us. We might call it the sun's
looking-glass, in which we see his image or reflection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>But we cannot at all times see the whole of it. When
we do, we call it a full moon, and, when we see only the edge
of it, we say it is a new moon. The moon itself does not
change its shape. It is always round, like an orange&mdash;a
dark round ball, which we should never see at all, if the sun
did not light it up for us; and it is only a part of the time
we can see the side which is lighted up.</p>

<p>Which do you suppose is the larger,&mdash;the moon, or the
stars? Now I know you will say the moon, because it looks
so much larger; but you must remember that the stars are
so far away, we can hardly see them at all, and the moon is
our own moon, and much nearer to us than our own sun.</p>

<p>We can see more of it than we can see of the stars; but
it is a very small thing indeed, compared with one of them.
It would take about fifty moons to make one such earth as
we live on, and it would take more earths than you can
count to make one star or sun.</p>

<h2>THE ROBBERY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I must</span> tell you of something that happened one day last
summer, when I was at the Zo&ouml;logical Garden in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Among the persons standing around the cage where the
monkeys were kept, was an old lady who had on a pair of
gold-rimmed spectacles. All at once, a big brown monkey
stretched out his paw between the bars, snatched the spectacles,
and scampered away, chattering and grinning with
delight.</p>

<p>Of course, the poor lady was in distress. The keeper
came to the rescue, and, by driving the monkey about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cage with a long pole, forced him at last to drop the spectacles.
But one of the glasses had come out of it; and this
the thief still held in his mouth, and refused to give up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus105.png" width="500" height="372" alt="The Robbery" title="" />
</div>

<p>The keeper followed him sharply with the pole. Away
he went, swinging from one rope to another, screaming and
scolding all the time, until the keeper was so tired, that I
feared he would have to let the monkey keep the glass.
But this the keeper said would never do; for he knew, that,
if he let the monkey carry the day, he never could control
him again.</p>

<p>So the keeper still plied his pole. The monkey dodged
it as well as he could, until the blows came so thick and
fast, that he could bear them no longer, when he opened his
mouth, and let the glass drop.</p>

<p>Now comes the funniest part of the story. The glass fell
quite near the bars, just where the old lady was standing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and a gentleman took her parasol, which had a hooked
handle, to draw it within reach. But he put the parasol
in a little too far, and it slipped out of his hand.</p>

<p>Instantly a large yellow monkey wrapped his long tail
around it, and started off. Imagine the feelings of the poor
old lady&mdash;first robbed of her spectacles, and then of her
parasol!</p>

<p>But her property was all recovered at last; the robbers
were both punished; and she went on her way in peace.</p>

the law, and rise up in arms to
resist it, they would be guilty of
an insurrection.</p>


<p>Now, it happened (according to
Tommy's story) that all the dolls in the house, headed by
a naughty male doll of African descent, and known as
"Dandy Jim," rose in insurrection against their lawful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
queen, Lucy the First, whose brother, Duke Tommy, was
commander-in-chief of her Majesty's forces.</p>

<p>The rebels were well fortified in one corner of the play-room.
They had mounted several cannon on alphabet-blocks;
and a whole company of tin soldiers defended the
outworks. Besides this, a china dog and a wooden elephant
had been enlisted as allies, and stood bravely in front.</p>

<p>General Tommy felt a weight of responsibility upon his
shoulders, and, like a prudent soldier, he resolved not to go
into battle until his army was large enough to make victory
certain. So he enlisted Queen Lucy the First as a recruit.</p>

<p>Queen Lucy looked very grand in her paper cocked hat,
with a feather at the top. She carried a gun; and General
Tommy taught her how to fire it off. When all were ready
for the onset, he blew a trumpet.</p>

<p>The army marched in excellent order along the entry,
into the play-room; and not a soldier drew back as they
came within sight of the enemy. "Halt!" cried General
Tommy. The army halted. The traitor, "Dandy Jim,"
stood pointing his sword, and the dolls all kept still.</p>

<p>One long blast of the trumpet, and then the brave General
Tommy cried out, "Now, soldiers, on, on to victory!"</p>

<p>On they went. The tin soldiers were soon swept down.
The dog and the elephant were handsomely beaten; and,
rushing into the fort, General Tommy seized the traitor,
"Dandy Jim," by the throat, and said, "Now, sir, your
doom is a dungeon!"</p>

<p>The dolls all fell on their knees, and thus was the great
insurrection in Dolldom put down without bloodshed, and
the authority of Queen Lucy the First fully restored. Of
course, there was great rejoicing; and, when the reporter
left, General Tommy was preparing for a grand illumination.</p>

<h2>ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a fine summer day, a dove, that was perched upon
the branch of a tree, saw a bee fall into a stream that was
flowing past. The poor bee tried to get out of the water,
but could not.</p>

<p>The dove, seeing that the bee was struggling for her life,
dropped a leaf close beside her, so that she might climb on
to it, and save herself. This the bee at once did, and very
glad she was to find herself safe once more.</p>

<p>Not long after this, a sportsman, who was roaming through
the woods for game, saw the dove flying about, and lifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his gun to shoot her. But, just as he was taking aim, something
happened, that checked him in the act.</p>

<p>The bee, whose life had been saved by the dove, was
going about from flower to flower in search of honey, when
she saw the sportsman taking aim at the good dove that
had befriended her in her time of need. "That dove once
saved my life, and now I will save hers," thought the bee
to herself.</p>

<p>With that she flew at the sportsman, and stung him on
the lip. The poor fellow dropped his gun with a loud cry
of pain, which so startled the dove, that she flew away; and
the man did not have another chance to shoot her. "Surely
one good turn deserves another," thought the bee, as she
turned merrily to her work.</p>

<h2>A LETTER FROM TEXAS.</h2>


<p><i>Dear Children</i>,&mdash;I am writing this letter at my office-desk
in San Antonio, Texas, a long way off from some of
you who will read it. I am the big brother of a lot of little
ones, and they call me "Doc."</p>

<p>We take "The Nursery," and the little folks think it is
splendid. As soon as it comes, mamma reads the stories,
and shows them the pictures.</p>

<p>They crowd around her to listen: some of them sit down
on chairs like little ladies; some sit on the floor like beggars;
and some&mdash;I am sorry to say&mdash;lie flat down on the carpet,
like&mdash;certainly not like ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>What do you think, children, of boys and girls who lie on
the floor, and kick up their heels in the air? <i>You</i> would
not do so, would you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus111.png" width="500" height="383" alt="Reading the letter" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now listen! I want to tell you something about our cat.
When we first got her, she was a tiny kitten, and we fed her
on milk in a saucer. You ought to have seen her lap it up
with her little tongue! Don't you think it is a pretty sight
to see a kitten drinking milk? I do. But our cat isn't a
kitten any longer, but a great, big, grown cat.</p>

<p>Well, the other night she got locked up in the schoolroom.
You know Miss Anna and Miss Emma teach a big
school in our house, and Willie, Pressley, Eddie, May, and
Emily go to it. Sadie, "Little Lalla," and baby are too
young for school yet. These are my little brothers' and
sisters' names. There are eight of them mentioned here.
See if you can count them.</p>

<p>As soon as Emily found out that Kitty was locked up,
she ran to Miss Eliza and mamma, and asked them to let
her out; but they said, "No," for they knew that, if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
got out of the schoolroom, she would surely run into the
dining-room, and drink up the baby's milk. So she had to
stay there all night.</p>

<p>Early next morning, Miss Eliza went into the schoolroom
to let Kitty out; and what do you think she saw? There
was Kitty, fast asleep in Willie's little wagon, and four little
kittens lying by her side, fast asleep too.</p>

<p>When Miss Eliza went back to the nursery, and told the
children what she had seen, Eddie, May, Emily, Sadie, and
even "Little Lalla" set up a big shout, and, bursting out of
the nursery, ran shouting and laughing to the little wagon
in the schoolroom, where, sure enough, there they were,
four little ones. Three were gray and white, and one gray
and black. Kitty looked so pleased and so happy! You
ought to have seen her. Wasn't that a nice surprise?</p>

<p>May chose the one that looked most like Kitty: Emily and
Sadie each chose one of the gray-and-white ones, and Eddie
took the gray-and-black fellow.</p>

<p>To-day is Emily's birthday. She is seven years old, and
may have a little party. If she <i>does</i>, how I would like to
have you all here to play with her! However, at some
future time I may write, and tell you all about it.</p>

<p>But it is time for me to run home, and get some dinner:
so good-by.</p>

<h2>A STORY OF A SEAL.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> seal is an amphibious quadruped."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Aunt Emily, do not puzzle us with your
hard names," cries Johnny.</p>

<p>"But, Johnny, a lad seven years old ought to know that
<i>amphibious</i> means 'capable of living on land or water;' and
that <i>quadruped</i> means 'having four feet.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, now I understand," said Johnny. "But does the
seal have feet?"</p>

<p>"It has a sort of feet; but they are so wrapped up in the
skin, that they are not of much use on land, except to help
it to creep, after a fashion. So the seal passes most of its
time in the sea, coming on shore only to bask and sleep in
the sun, or to suckle its young ones. It is covered with a
close thick fur and is a very good swimmer."</p>

<p>"But let us have the story," said Jane.</p>

<p>"The story is this: once a fisherman, after harpooning
an old seal, found one of its young ones on the sand, and
took it home. Here it became the playmate of the children,
whom it seemed to love very much. They named it Blue-eyes.
It would play with them from morning till night,
would lick their hands, and call them with a gentle little
cry, not unlike the human voice in its tone.</p>

<p>"It would look at them tenderly with its large blue eyes,
shaded by long black lashes. It was very fond of music.
It would follow its master to fish, swimming around the
boat, and taking a great many fish, which it would give up
without even biting them. No dog could have been more
faithful, or more quick to learn what was wanted.</p>

<p>"But the fisherman's half-sister was a silly old woman.
She had come to help nurse his wife, who was ill. This
half-sister took it into her head that the poor seal would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
bring bad luck to the family. She told her brother that he
must get rid of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/illus115.png" width="365" height="400" alt="Seal" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Weary of her teasing, he at last took the poor seal,
rowed with it out into the open sea, and there, more than
seven miles from the shore, threw it into the water, and
then hurried home as fast as sails would carry him.</p>

<p>"But, when he entered his cottage, the first thing he saw
was the faithful seal lying close beside the cradle of one of
his children. As soon as it saw its master, it showed great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
joy, and tried to caress him. But he took the seal and
gave it away to a sailor, who was going on a long voyage.
Two weeks afterward, as the fisherman came back from his
boat, he saw the seal at play with the children.</p>

<p>"'If you do not kill that seal, I will kill it myself,' said
the old aunt. The children began to cry. 'No, no, you
shall not kill it!' cried Hans with flashing eyes. 'You shall
kill me first,' cried little Jane. 'You have no right to kill
it,' cried Mary, the eldest girl.</p>

<p>"'Am I to be ruled by these children?' said the silly
aunt, turning to her brother.</p>

<p>"'The seal shall live,' said he: 'the children shall have
their way. Your notion that the poor seal brings bad luck
is a very silly notion. You ought to be ashamed of it.'</p>

<p>"'Hurrah!' cried Hans. 'Blue-eyes, the vote is taken:
you are to live, and all this nonsense about your bringing
bad luck is blown away.'</p>

<p>"The seal began to flop about as if in great joy.</p>

<p>"'I shall leave the house at once,' said the silly aunt.</p>

<p>"'Do as you please,' said the fisherman.</p>

<p>"And so it turned out, that the only ill luck brought to
the family by the seal was the departure of the cross and
silly old aunt. And, if the truth were known, this was
found to be a very good thing for all. The fisherman
prospered, the mother of the children got well at once; and
all were happier than ever before, including Blue-eyes, who
now was the jolliest seal that ever played with children."</p>

<h2>FUN IN WINTER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ground was white with snow. The sky looked black
as though another storm were coming. The day was very
cold; but the tough boys and girls did not mind the cold
weather. They were out to have some fun.</p>

<p>Their rubber boots, and thick coats and mittens, kept
them dry and warm. One of the boys, though, had come
out bare-headed. He was the boy who never <i>could</i> find
his cap when he wanted it. His name was Tom.</p>

<p>"Now look here, Tom," said his brother Sam, a sturdy
little chap, who was always trying to keep Tom in order;
"this won't do. You go into the house and get your cap.
Go quick, or you'll get this snowball right in your face."</p>

<p>"Fire away!" said Tom, dancing around, and putting up
his arm to keep off the snowball.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to have a hand in this game," said Joe,
aiming a snowball at Sam. "Look out for yourself, old
fellow."</p>

<p>"Clear the track!" cried Bill and Ned, rolling a huge
snowball down the hill.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Sullivan, who was just going up the back-steps to
ask for cold victuals, looked around to see what was going
on; while Charles had his own fun in dragging his little
sister up the hill on her sled.</p>

<p>All this time, a little boy named Jim, who had been
having a private coast in the field near the house, was
peeping over the fence, and wishing he were old enough to
play with the other boys. He didn't venture to join them,
for he was bashful, and rather timid: but he saw all that
took place, and he will remember all about it when he sees
this picture.</p>

<h2>OLD WHITEY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> a great boy six years old, and I take "The Nursery."
Some of the stories I spell out myself; but the most of them
mamma reads aloud to my little brother Albert and me.</p>

<p>Last summer, we all went to visit an uncle who lives on a
large farm. We had just the best kind of a time. There
was a big dog, named Rover, that would play with us for
hours. He would run after and bring back a ball or stick, or
any thing that we would throw for him. He would "speak,"
"roll over," "sit up and read," and do lots of funny tricks.</p>

<p>Then there was a white horse twenty-five years old, and
just as sleek and fat as a colt. Old Whitey has lived on
the farm ever since he was a little colt. Old as he is, he is
still able to do a great deal of work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus119.png" width="500" height="381" alt="Old Whitey running away" title="" />
</div>

<p>One day Uncle Wash was ploughing, and he put me on
the back of Old Whitey. Well, I liked that very much, and
began to cluck, and jerk the reins, to make him go along;
when in an instant, without any warning, he pricked up
his ears, kicked up his heels, and ran away, leaving the
plough behind.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how scared I was. I held on as long as I
could; but it was of no use. The old horse ran through
swamps and bogs, and dropped me, head first, in the mud
and dirt. I was hurt on my head and side, but I would not
cry because I was too big for that. When the men got to
me, I was hunting for my hat.</p>

<p>After getting rid of his load, the runaway coolly walked
up to the barn, and stood looking as mild as a lamb. I
didn't have any faith in Old Whitey after that, though
his master said he never knew him to do such a thing
before.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, this is weather for play, for play!<br />

So he hung his satchel upon a tree:<br />
And over the hills to the pond went he,<br />
To frolic, and see what he could see.<br />
<br /><br />
He met a boy on the way to school,<br />
And said, "Ned Foster, you're a fool<br />

Quoth Ned, "You'll find that <i>he's</i> the fool<br />

<br /><br />
Then Ned passed cheerily on his way,<br />

<h2>WHY DO THEY ALL LOVE FREDDY?</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">But</span> do they all love Freddy, mamma?"</p>

<p>"I think there is no doubt of it, Freddy. The cat loves
you; for she will let you pull her about, and never try to
scratch you."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I think old Towser loves me. He lets me get
on his back: he never bites me."</p>

<p>"I would like to catch him at it&mdash;biting my little
Freddy! He knows too much for that; and, besides, he
loves you."</p>

<p>"But does the old cow love me, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Why, didn't she let you play with her calf, and never
try to hook you? The old cow loves Freddy, and will give
him all the fresh milk he wants."</p>

<p>"The hens love me because I feed them."</p>

<p>"Yes, the hens love you; and, more than that, the little
sparrows love you; for they follow you, and hop about your
feet, as if they wanted to say, 'Good-morning, Freddy!
We all love you, Freddy.'"</p>

<p>"But I will tell you one beast that does not love me,
mamma. The old sow does not love me."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it, little boy! The old sow loves you
just as well as Towser does; just as well as the cow does;
just as well as old Scamper, the horse, loves you."</p>

<p>"I should like to be sure that the sow loves me."</p>

<p>"Come with me, and I will put you on her back; and, if
she does not like it, it will be a sign that she does not love
you; but, if she does like it, it will be a sign that she loves
my little Freddy just as much as the others do."</p>

<p>So mamma took Freddy, and placed him on the back of
the old sow. The old sow gave a look over her ears, saw it
was Freddy, and then uttered a contented grunt, as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as to say, "All right! Freddy, you are a darling, and I
love you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/illus123.png" width="457" height="450" alt="The Sow" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Did I not tell you that the old sow loved you, like the
rest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma; but why, why, do they love me? Tell
me that."</p>

<p>Mamma snatched Freddy up in her arms, took him into
the house, and then said, "I think they must love you,
Freddy, because you love them. Love wins love, you know.
The person who says that no one loves him should ask himself
the question, 'But do I love any one?'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Cousin John asked

rabbits. I said I would like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
them very much. So he gave
them to me, and I had a pen
made for them.</p>

<p>One I called Pink, and the
other White. They were very
tame, and soon got to know
their names. I took them out
and let them run about the yard
every fine day.</p>

<p>Once Pink ran away, and I
thought he was lost. I had a
long chase after him through
the bushes; but I caught him
at last and brought him home.</p>

<p>My brother George kept a
lot of chickens in the yard, and
while I fed my pet rabbits, he
would feed his chickens.</p>

<h2>THE COUNCIL OF BUZZARDS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> buzzard is a large black bird, nearly as large as
a turkey. He never kills that he may eat, but devours
the refuse in the city streets, and the dead animals on the
prairies and swamps of the Southern States. It is against
the law to shoot buzzards; for they are the health officers
of the South.</p>

<p>Here, in beautiful, sunny Louisiana, I seldom look out
doors without seeing one or more buzzards slowly circling
around in the air in quest of food. Before they begin to
eat, they arrange themselves in a solemn row, as if holding
a council, and "caw" in a very wise manner. Then one
flies down, and then another, and another; and as they eat,
they seem to comment on their repast. At last nothing is
left of it but the bare bones to bleach in the sun. They
will eat an ox in a day.</p>

Three little dogs were basking in the cinders,<br />
And three little cats were playing in the windows,<br />
Three little mice popp'd out of a hole,<br />
And a piece of cheese they stole, they stole!<br />
The three little cats jump'd up in a trice,<br />
And crack'd the bones of the three little mice,<br />
The three little mice.<br />
